<h2>Planet Wars is Based on Galcon</h2>
<p>Planet Wars is inspired by Galcon, a popular iPhone and desktop strategy
  game. A huge thank-you goes out to the creator of Galcon,
  <a href="http://www.philhassey.com">Phil Hassey</a>, for
  letting us use his idea. We wanted to show Phil some love for being so
  awesome by saying a few words about Galcon here.</p>
<p>You can play Galcon online against other people for free
  <a href="http://www.galcon.com/flash/">here</a>. The Galcon homepage is
  <a href="http://www.galcon.com/">here</a>. You can play Galcon on your
  <a href="http://www.galcon.com/fusion/">desktop</a>,
  <a href="http://www.galcon.com/iphone/">phone</a>, or
  <a href="http://www.galcon.com/flash/">on the web</a>. If you love Galcon
  as much as we do, then consider buying it!</p>
